# MyAudio: Audio App Simulator

## Overview

`MyAudio` is an audio content management simulator designed as part of my assignment for Computer Science II (CPS 209). This application facilitates the management of various audio content types, such as songs, audiobooks, and podcasts, in a simulated library. Additionally, it interacts with a virtual online store to download and manage audio content.
